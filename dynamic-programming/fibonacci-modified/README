Problem description:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fibonacci-modified

Got a lot of "inspiration" from solution posted by user sonle_hut in discussion
page in hackerrank. I attach the file with his/her solution since he did not
attach any license to it as far as I could see.

To compile (in Mac OS with developers tools installed):
clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Weverything -Wno-c++98-compat-pedantic -Wno-c++98-compat -Wno-padded fibonacci-modified.cpp -o fibonacci

To run:
./fibonacci
